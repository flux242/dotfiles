   From the sun's surface on out, the wavelengths SDO observes, measured in Angstroms, are:

    4500: Showing the sun's surface or photosphere.
    1700: Shows surface of the sun, as well as a layer of the sun's atmosphere called the chromosphere, which lies just above the photosphere and is where the temperature begins rising.
    1600: Shows a mixture between the upper photosphere and what's called the transition region, a region between the chromosphere and the upper most layer of the sun's atmosphere called the corona. The transition region is where the temperature rapidly rises.
     304: This light is emitted from the chromosphere and transition region.
     171: This wavelength shows the sun's atmosphere, or corona, when it's quiet. It also shows giant magnetic arcs known as coronal loops.
     193: Shows a slightly hotter region of the corona, and also the much hotter material of a solar flare.
     211: This wavelength shows hotter, magnetically active regions in the sun's corona.
     335: This wavelength also shows hotter, magnetically active regions in the corona.
      94: This highlights regions of the corona during a solar flare.
     131: The hottest material in a flare.'
